/*   what is your site's primary purpose?   */

  The primary purpose of my website is to document my time at EDA as a student on the Web Developer Boot Camp course in Wellington.

  It should document my progress over the duration of the Course, 19 weeks, in three aspects of the programme:
    #1. Technical knowledge and skills, through 'technical' blogs in Phase 0 of the course,
    #2. Cultural and personal development, through 'cultural' blogs in Phase 0 of the course, and
    #3. Projects - coding assignments and achievements, through 'project' blogs in Phase 1 of the course.

  My blog might also be developed to provide access to associated aspects of my career, such as my Curriculum Vitae, Linked-in Profile, GitHub Contributions and Contact Details.


/*   who is your target audience?   */

  My initial audience is that of EDA staff and fellow students as well as potential future students.

  However, my website might further be developed to act as a showcase of my work, via the provision of code samples and completed projects, to future employers seeking web developers.


/*   how do you want site visitors to interact with your site?   */

  My website should primarily be a showcase for my work, illustrating my progress as a web developer.

  Therefore, it must be easy for potential employers or other interested parties to contact me.

/*   what experience would you like them to have?   */

  I'd like them to have an easy time navigating my website: clean, concise and simple with no fancy gadgets.

  And for them to think: "This person can code".


/*   how do you want site visitors to interact with your site?   */

  I'd want visitors to interact with my site, primarily when they have a moment of quality time to engage with my work and to reflect, probably at a desk but maybe whilst sitting on a train using their mobile device - tablet or smart phone.


/*   how will you build you site to support your desired user experience?   */

  I'll be my website iteratively with its Home Page acting as a index/menu,and with easy and fast loading access to my blogs and projects.
